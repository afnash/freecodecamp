  <li><strong>1856</strong>: Born on <strong>July 10</strong> in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia), into a Serbian Orthodox family; his father was a priest, and his mother, an inventor of household devices, inspired his interest in innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>1870s</strong>: Enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz to study electrical engineering, where he first encountered the concept of alternating current (AC), but left school without graduating.</li>
  <li><strong>1881</strong>: Worked as a chief electrician in a telegraph company in Budapest, where he conceptualized the rotating magnetic field, a foundation for AC motors.</li>
  <li><strong>1884</strong>: Moved to the United States and joined <strong>Thomas Edison's company</strong>, but differences over DC versus AC power systems led to their parting ways.</li>
  <li><strong>1887–1888</strong>: Developed and patented the <strong>AC induction motor</strong> and polyphase AC system, which he licensed to <strong>George Westinghouse</strong>, sparking the "War of the Currents" against Edison’s DC system.</li>
  <li><strong>1891</strong>: Became a naturalized U.S. citizen and invented the <strong>Tesla coil</strong>, which remains a cornerstone in radio technology.</li>
  <li><strong>1893</strong>: Played a key role in demonstrating the safety and efficiency of AC at the <strong>World's Columbian Exposition</strong> in Chicago, solidifying its adoption as the standard for electricity distribution.</li>
  <li><strong>1898</strong>: Pioneered wireless communication by demonstrating a radio-controlled boat, a precursor to modern remote control technology.</li>
  <li><strong>1900s</strong>: Worked on ambitious projects like <strong>Wardenclyffe Tower</strong>, aiming to transmit wireless power worldwide, but funding issues led to its abandonment.</li>
  <li><strong>1920s–1930s</strong>: Focused on visionary but speculative ideas like particle-beam weaponry (dubbed the "death ray") and free energy systems.</li>
  <li><strong>1943</strong>: Passed away on <strong>January 7</strong> in New York City at age 86, impoverished but celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to electrical engineering, wireless communication, and visionary science.</li>
